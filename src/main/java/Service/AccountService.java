// ## 1: Our API should be able to process new User registrations.

// As a user, I should be able to create a new Account on the endpoint POST localhost:8080/register. The body will contain a representation of a JSON Account, but will not contain an account_id.

// - The registration will be successful if and only if the username is not blank, the password is at least 4 characters long, and an Account with that username does not already exist. If all these conditions are met, the response body should contain a JSON of the Account, including its account_id. The response status should be 200 OK, which is the default. The new account should be persisted to the database.
// - If the registration is not successful, the response status should be 400. (Client error)

// ## 2: Our API should be able to process User logins.

// As a user, I should be able to verify my login on the endpoint POST localhost:8080/login. The request body will contain a JSON representation of an Account, not containing an account_id. In the future, this action may generate a Session token to allow the user to securely use the site. We will not worry about this for now.

// - The login will be successful if and only if the username and password provided in the request body JSON match a real account existing on the database. If successful, the response body should contain a JSON of the account in the response body, including its account_id. The response status should be 200 OK, which is the default.
// - If the login is not successful, the response status should be 401. (Unauthorized)
